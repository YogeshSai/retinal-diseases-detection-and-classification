# retinal-diseases-detection-and-classification

Requirements
- Anaconda
- Tensorflow = conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow
- OpenCV = pip install opencv-python

Download the dataset from the kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/kermany2018
Place the dataset in the same folder as of the Train&Val code file

You can download the model from the link
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z2gkPJa1ztrGzd4lTdFJOT6Z-JacMGrC/view?usp=sharing

-> Run the Train&Val code to create a trained model that will detect and classify retinal diseases
-> Run the Eval code to identify the disease from the user input

The ouput will be classified as CNV, DMW, DRUSEN & NORMAL
